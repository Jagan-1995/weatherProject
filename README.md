## Objective :

- Created a backend application with an API endpoint weather.

## Outcome :

- This will show the current temperature for the given location.

## Tools used:

- IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, Postman

## Key Technologies:

- Java & Spring Boot: Robust backend framework.
- RestTemplate: For smooth API interactions.
- Jackson: Efficient JSON parsing and data handling.
- Swagger UI: it helps to visualize and interact with the API's resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.

## How It Works:

- Enter Your City: Input the city name you want to check the weather.
- Fetch Data: The app calls the OpenWeatherMap API link - [Open Weather map](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3#start) 
- Display Results: See the detailed weather forecast instantly!
